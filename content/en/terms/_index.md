**ClarityGov Terms of Service**

The following document governs the usage of our (ClarityGov and all affiliates) site and services. These but are not limited to: [https://claritygov.com](https://claritygov.com), [https://api.claritygov.com](https://api.claritygov.com), documentation, and all current, planned, and future integrations and services. 

**About**

ClarityGov develops and creates software tools in order to increase Government Transparency. These tools include but are not limited to developer APIs, custom integrations, and documentation. ClarityGov API and all services are currently free and publicly accessible. Certain parts of the ClarityGov platform are also open source under the MIT license. 

**Acceptable Use**

Our site and services are open to any person for both public and private (commercial) usage, except for actions detailed in “Unacceptable Use” below.  

**Unacceptable Use**

ClarityGov operates a free service, and as such the following actions are prohibited:



* DDOS attacks on any of our services.
* Automated access to our site or services (except when using our documented API or local integrations).
* Tampering with, modifying, reverse engineering, or altering any of our services.
* Bypassing API rate limits or other access control (see “API Access”)

This is not a comprehensive list, and ClarityGov reserves the right to refuse access to our platform and services for any reason. Unacceptable use will lead to revocation of access to our platform and services.

**API Access**

The ClarityGov API provides developers a powerful way to programmatically scrape and access governmental data. Access to this API is currently free without registration, but individual usage is subject to review and may be blocked without warning or reason should it exceed acceptable ranges. 

**Contact**

For additional information regarding our services or governing terms, please contact the developer at [ian.mcvann@gmail.com](mailto:ian.mcvann@gmail.com)

**Disclaimer**

Our Terms of Service may be subject to change. While we may notify users for larger changes, it should not be expected nor is required. The aforementioned terms describe services current as of the date updated. New services may be subject to updated data collection practices even if they are not included in this document. Additionally, should any jurisdiction find any part of these terms to be inadmissible, unenforceable, or otherwise invalid, the entirety of the remaining document remains in force.
