**ClarityGov Privacy Policy**

The following policy dictates how we (ClarityGov and all affiliates) collect, store, and maintain your data. It also describes what data may be shared with third-party services that ClarityGov’s service uses to operate.

**Information Collected**

ClarityGov utilizes services that may track information including but not limited to:
* IP Address
* Device Identification details
* Approximate Location
* Associated Cookies
* Time of Request

The services are described below. 

**Google Analytics**

ClarityGov utilizes Google Analytics to track usage of our platform. Usage of Google Analytics and data that Google collects can be found on their site here: [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span>

**Google Account Data**

Usage of the Google Sheets integration for ClarityGov requires OAuth consent, thus providing us with data about your Google account. This data is not used for anything inside of ClarityGov, and is only used to request permissions in order for the app to function. We do not track this data directly.

ClarityGov’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.

**Firebase**

ClarityGov utilizes Firebase and associated services in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as the backend for the publicly provided service. Both services have their own terms and policies. Each visit to our website (https://claritygov.com) and associated actions may be logged via GCP for internal review.

**Additional Services**

ClarityGov may implement additional services with separate data collection practices in order to improve our service. These services may not be documented in our Privacy Policy. 

**Contact**

For additional information regarding our services or governing terms, please contact the developer at ian.mcvann@gmail.com

**Disclaimer**

Our privacy policy may be subject to change. While we may notify users for larger changes, it should not be expected nor is required. The aforementioned policy describes services current as of the date updated. New services may be subject to updated data collection practices even if they are not included in this document. Additionally, should any jurisdiction find any part of this policy to be inadmissible, unenforceable, or otherwise invalid, the entirety of the remaining document remains in force.
